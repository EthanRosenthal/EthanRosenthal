### Hi there üëã

I work at [Runway](https://runwayml.com/). My GitHub is mainly a collection of largely useless side projects.

I write about many of these side projects on my [blog](https://www.ethanrosenthal.com).

I ~~tweet~~ [toot](https://recsys.social/@ethanrosenthal) / [skeet](https://bsky.app/profile/ethanrosenthal.com) sometimes, mostly about data things, though urbanist rants sneek through.

My repositories, sorted by star count, descending are:
