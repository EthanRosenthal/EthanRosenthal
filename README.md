### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work in AI/ML/DS/WHATEV at Square. My GitHub is mainly a collection of largely useless side projects.

I write about many of these side projects on my [blog](https://www.ethanrosenthal.com).

I [tweet](https://twitter.com/eprosenthal) sometimes, mostly about data things, though urbanist rants sneek through.
